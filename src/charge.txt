if youre still or run he will eat you so you should never secong guess yourself
make a strong decision and go with it one way or other you will learn
if its a wrong one you will learn if its right you will learn

spring tool suite

create a java project

oops project

src new class

SavingsAccountTest.java
main and space bar
sysout

psvm in vscode
so print

savings account assignment set show withdraw deposit
assignment

A small assignment to everyone,
Innovate a class out of your imagination, with some data and functions,
It MUST NOT REPEAT in our batch of 18 members

the height of your success cant increase the height of personal development 
to start hsqldb server 
java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 file:mydb --dbname.0 xdb
to start application 
 java -jar hsqldb.jar

it has to be a unique ONE
intellij right click open module settings modules select dependencies click on + and add hsqlsb.jar file from lib and your good to go

exception handling....


in goals type 
clean compile test 
mutli threading 

perform car driven by short drive or long drive 
define exceptions total 

what if child class also has exception also 

throws is not necessary for run time exception 
child cant write a method where parent is not ready for exeption 	

class FallException extends Exception {

}
class DrukenMaster{
void drinkAndFight(){
//capable for 5 techniques 
}

}

class DrunkDisciple extends DrukenMaster{
void drinkAndFight() throws FallenException{ 
//caplable to use 10 techniques 
}
}


explain if parent can extend fight exception then child can extend 
fallen exception 
knockkonckdown exception 


//savingsAccount  fun() -3 exceptions 
//FixedDepositException  -3 exceptions 








persistent object --> object already in the data base 


code marathon eclipse 
how much portion will be there for first exam 
day section 1, section 2 
till day 3 

2nd exam day 4,day 5 

like deleteDepartmentTest
like insertDepartmentTest ->naming conventions like this end or start 


expection is assertion si falling right place 
test cases how to write and rull
@Test ->ANNOTATIONS 

@tABLE
@iD --ANNOTATIONS 
is extra information in java


tommorrow exam 
main concern is 
how to write proper clean code 
with comments and write  with 
proper naming conventions 
so keep this in mind and write this responsibility 
as a original project where others need to see your code like that 


charcoal to diamond takes million years 

pressure but take it as oppurtunity''

Good scenario always take 


synchronize void eat 


try{

wait(); //a notif() function will interupt this 


}

use finalize 





///// to write a spring 

needed 
1. your pojo | business entity 
2. 



clean compile test bas 
scope = prototype for different location of car object 
<constructor when dealing with constructors 
<property when dealing with methods 

//ctrl + shift +M auto import 
@Component
|no need to write xml file 
|
used to auto detection of classes 

@auto wired  
|
|
use of annotations....
it will intimate the parameter required to 
its belonging classes and automatically 
required object is created...

automatically acquire what are the dependencies 


java mcq test revision 



exception handling 
types checked and unchecked 
compile time is checked 

if it is extending from exception class then checked 
runtime exception is unchecked

drunken master and drunken slave example 

cant be thrown by child if super 
child can only throw extended exception

throws compulsory in checked exception 
checked Exception and for runtime we no need to add throws
in run time no need 


marker interfaces 
is an empty interfaces guide virtual machine no mtds 
no variables 


final never be overridden 

static only static method 

non static can acccess static 

this.
super()
super.
this()


string buffer is thread safe and synchronized

and builder is not thread safe 



generic programming 
comparater comparable 
methods in multi threading 
list set 
upto assertions 


mvc -->model view controller 

		controller--a servlet - dispatch servlet  
		    |	request/response 
model 				view 
(data)
database			static:html/css
pojo				dynamic : jsp pages 
repositories 


dynamic convert to maven 
configure change too maven project 
add the dependencies in pom.xml
add the dispatcher servlet in web.xml
create spring-servlet.xml filr <--spring beans configured here 
if web.xml is not there go to project 
java ee tools generate deployment descriptor stub 

internal resource view has location for jsp page 

"/"

spring booot is nothing but automatic configuratiosn 
all were managed

spring starter project 
recomd to create all in packages 
http://localhost:8080/burgers/greet
controller @RestCOntroller
@RequestMapping("/burgers")
com.kpit.controllers
entity
repositiries 
services

xml json 
java script object notation 
@RestController 
@RequestMapping
package layer1 ->pizza
layer2->pizza repositiries
layer3 ->pizza services
layer4 ->pizza controller

netstat -a
netstat -ano
netstat -ano | "8080"
taskkill /PID 16300 /F  -> to kill port 


rest api 
angular project 
u have to combine angular with spring rest 

@RequestMapping("/showSinglePizza{pid})



java mcq test 2 
exception handling 
multi threading 
design pattern 
test 

multi threading many methods 
which thread catually wait to complete 
thread should complete 
join  
when we ovveride it should be public or private method ist no.. 

can we override static methods 
only instance ans accessible ovverriden 

java.lang 

getClass()

returns class object Class<T> in class getTypeName() determines type information in 
string manner 
getAnnotations() return Annotation[]

getClass.getAnnotations

can string base musical instrument extends from 
another abstract class -> no we cant 

assertions methods 

Assertions.assertTrue
Assertions.assertFalse verify whether it there  or not 

how do we add unique objects in hashset 
-->equals and hashcode 
both will be overridden 

class A
{
void fun(){}
}
class B extends A{
@Override
void fuun(){

}
}


sometimes super class will be not available so use override


cloning 
object class there a method java1.8 docs java.lang 

creates a and returns copy of object 

clone()

finalze()
garbage collector 

finally block  pupose 
release the resource 


1 million objects creating garbage collection process 
error in java virtual machine can u handle the error ->no 
storm in ocean cant be handled only in ship can be handled 


only exceptions can be caught errors cant be caught 

spring web application can be secure 
register via github and google 
we will see today like that 
authentication which is secure and robust 



code marathon....
codecheff
not dsa based but basic programming 

good cheff java 
case study one code will be produced 
two bank accounts were given 
and source account balnce should be display
